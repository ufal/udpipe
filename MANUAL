UDPipe
Version 0.9.0-devel

Introduction
============

UDPipe is an trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and
dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be
trained given only annotated data in CoNLL-U format. Trained models are provided
for nearly all UD treebanks. UDPipe is available as a binary, as a library for
C++, Python, Perl, Java, C#, and as a web service.

UDPipe is a free software under Mozilla Public License 2.0
(http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) and the linguistic models are free for
non-commercial use and distributed under CC BY-NC-SA
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license, although for some
models the original data used to create the model may impose additional
licensing conditions. UDPipe is versioned using Semantic Versioning
(http://semver.org/).

Platforms and Requirements
--------------------------

UDpipe is available as a standalone tool and as a library for Linux/Windows/OS
X. It does not require any additional libraries. As any supervised machine
learning tool, it needs trained linguistic models.


UDPipe Installation
===================

UDPipe releases are available on GitHub (http://github.com/ufal/udpipe), either
as a pre-compiled binary package, or source code only. The binary package
contains Linux, Windows and OS X binaries, Java bindings binary, C# bindings
binary, and source code of UDPipe and all language bindings. While the binary
packages do not contain compiled Python or Perl bindings, packages for those
languages are available in standard package repositories, i.e. on PyPI and CPAN.

To use UDPipe, a language model is needed. Here is a list of available language
models (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe#language_models).

If you want to compile UDPipe manually, sources are available on on GitHub
(http://github.com/ufal/udpipe), both in the pre-compiled binary package
releases (http://github.com/ufal/udpipe/releases) and in the repository itself.

Model Description
-----------------

The Universal Dependencies 1.2 models contain 36 models, each consisting of a
tokenizer, tagger, lemmatizer and dependency parser, all trained using the UD
data. The model for Japanese is missing, because we do not have the license for
the required corpus of Mainichi Shinbun 1995.

The tokenizer is trained using the SpaceAfter=No features. If the features are
not present in the data, they can be filled in using raw text in the language in
question (surprisingly, quite little data suffices, we use 500kB).

The tagger, lemmatizer and parser are trained using gold UD data.

Details about model architecture and training process can be found in the
(Straka et al. 2016) paper.


Model Performance
-----------------

We present the tagger, lemmatizer and parser performance, measured on the
testing portion of the data. Only the segmentation and the tokenization of the
testing data is retained before evaluation. Therefore, the dependency parser is
evaluated without gold POS tags.

Running UDPipe
--------------

Probably the most common usage of UDPipe is to tokenize, tag and parse input
using
  udpipe --tokenize --tag --parse udpipe_model

The input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding and can be either already tokenized
and segmented, or it can be a plain text which is tokenized and segmented
automatically.

Any number of files can be specified after the udpipe_model and if no file is
given, input is read from standard input. The output is by default saved to
standard output, but if --outfile=name is used, it is saved to the given file
name. The output file name can contain a {}, which is replaced by a base name of
the processed file (i.e., without directories and an extension).

The full command syntax of running UDPipe is
  udpipe [options] udpipe_model file ...
  Options: --input=[conllu|horizontal|vertical]
           --outfile=output file template
           --output=[conllu|horizontal|vertical]
           --tokenize (perform tokenization)
           --tokenizer=tokenizer options, implies --tokenize
           --tag (perform tagging)
           --tagger=tagger options, implies --tag
           --parse (perform parsing)
           --parser=parser options, implies --parse


Tokenizer
---------

If the --tokenize input is supplied, the input is assumed to be plain text and
is tokenized using model tokenizer. Additional arguments to the tokenizer might
be specified using --tokenizer=data option (which implies --tokenize).


Input Formats
-------------

If the tokenizer is not used, the input format is specified using the --input
option. Currently supported input formats are:
- conllu (default): the CoNLL-U format
  (http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html)
- horizontal: each sentence on a separate line, with tokens separated by spaces
- vertical: each token on a separate line, with an empty line denoting end of
  sentence; only the first space-separated word is used as a token, the rest of
  the line is ignored


Tagger
------

If the --tag input is supplied, the input is POS tagged lemmatized using the
model tagger. Additional arguments to the tagger might be specified using
--tagger=data option (which implies --tag).


Dependency Parsing
------------------

If the --parse input is supplied, the input is parsed using the model dependency
parser.  Additional arguments to the parser might be specified using
--parser=data option (which implies --parse).


Output Formats
--------------

The output format is specified using the --output option. Currently supported
output formats are:
- conllu (default): the CoNLL-U format
  (http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html)
- horizontal: each sentence on a separate line, with words separated by a
  single space
- vertical: each word on a separate line, with an empty line denoting end of
  sentence


Running the UDPipe REST Server
------------------------------

UDPipe also provides REST server binary udpipe_server. The binary uses
MicroRestD (http://github.com/ufal/microrestd) as a REST server implementation
and provides UDPipe REST API
(http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/api-reference.php).

The full command syntax of udpipe_server is
  udpipe_server [options] port (rest_id model_file acknowledgements)*
  Options: --daemon

The udpipe_server can run either in foreground or in background (when --daemon
is used). The specified model files are loaded during start and kept in memory
all the time. This behaviour may change in future to load the models on demand.


Training UDPipe Models
----------------------

TODO


Measuring Model Accuracy
------------------------

Measuring custom model accuracy can be performed by running:
  udpipe --accuracy [udpipe_options] udpipe_model file ...

The command syntax is similar to the regular UDPipe operation, only the input
must be always in CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html) and the --input and --output
options are ignored.

If --tokenize(r) option is passed, tokenizer performance is evaluted (using
SpaceAfter=No features of the input file). If --tag(ger) and/or --parse(r)
options are passed, tagger and/or dependency parser performance is evaluated,
respectively.


UDPipe API Reference
====================

The UDPipe API is defined in header udpipe.h and resides in ufal::udpipe
namespace. The API allows only using existing models, for custom model creation
you have to use the train_parser binary.

The strings used in the UDPipe API are always UTF-8 encoded (except from file
paths, whose encoding is system dependent).


UDPipe Versioning
-----------------

UDPipe is versioned using Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/). Therefore, a
version consists of three numbers major.minor.patch, optionally followed by a
hyphen and pre-release version info, with the following semantics:

- Stable versions have no pre-release version info, development have non-empty
  pre-release version info.
- Two versions with the same major.minor have the same API with the same
  behaviour, apart from bugs. Therefore, if only patch is increased, the new
  version is only a bug-fix release.
- If two versions v and u have the same major, but minor(v) is greater than
  minor(u), version v contains only additions to the API. In other words, the
  API of u is all present in v with the same behaviour (once again apart from
  bugs). It is therefore safe to upgrade to a newer UDPipe version with the same
  major.
- If two versions differ in major, their API may differ in any way.

Models created by UDPipe have the same behaviour in all UDPipe versions with
same major, apart from obvious bugfixes. On the other hand, models created from
the same data by different major.minor UDPipe versions may have different
behaviour.


Class version
-------------

  class version {
   public:
    unsigned major;
    unsigned minor;
    unsigned patch;
    std::string prerelease;

    static version current();
  };

The version class represents UDPipe version. See UDPipe Versioning for more
information.


version::current
----------------

  static version current();

Returns current UDPipe version.


C++ Bindings API
----------------

Bindings for other languages than C++ are created using SWIG from the C++
bindings API, which is a slightly modified version of the native C++ API. Main
changes are replacement of string_piece type by native strings and removal of
methods using istream. Here is the C++ bindings API declaration:

C# Bindings
-----------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the Ufal.UDPipe namespace.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. The
bindings requires native C++ library libudpipe_csharp (called udpipe_csharp on
Windows).


Java Bindings
-------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the cz.cuni.mff.ufal.udpipe package.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Java interface, see cz.cuni.mff.ufal.udpipe.Words class for
reference. Also, class members are accessible and modifiable using using
getField and setField wrappers.

The bindings require native C++ library libudpipe_java (called udpipe_java on
Windows). If the library is found in the current directory, it is used,
otherwise standard library search process is used.


Perl Bindings
-------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the Ufal::UDPipe
(http://search.cpan.org/~straka/Ufal-UDPipe/) package. The classes can be
imported into the current namespace using the :all export tag.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Perl interface, see Ufal::UDPipe::Words for reference. Static
methods and enumerations are available only through the module, not through
object instance.


Python Bindings
---------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the ufal.udpipe
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ufal.udpipe) module.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. In Python
2, strings can be both unicode and UTF-8 encoded str, and the library always
produces unicode. In Python 3, strings must be only str.
