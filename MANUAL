UDPipe
Version 1.0.0

Introduction
============

UDPipe is an trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and
dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be
trained given only annotated data in CoNLL-U format. Trained models are provided
for nearly all UD treebanks. UDPipe is available as a binary, as a library for
C++, Python, Perl, Java, C#, and as a web service.

UDPipe User's Manual
====================

Like any supervised machine learning tool, UDPipe needs a trained linguistic
model. This section describes the available language models and also the
commandline tools and interfaces.


Running UDPipe
--------------

Probably the most common usage of UDPipe is to tokenize, tag and parse input
using
  udpipe --tokenize --tag --parse udpipe_model

The input is assumed to be in UTF-8 encoding and can be either already tokenized
and segmented, or it can be a plain text which is tokenized and segmented
automatically.

Any number of files can be specified after the udpipe_model and if no file is
given, input is read from standard input. The output is by default saved to
standard output, but if --outfile=name is used, it is saved to the given file
name. The output file name can contain a {}, which is replaced by a base name of
the processed file (i.e., without directories and an extension).

The full command syntax of running UDPipe is
  Usage: udpipe [running_opts] udpipe_model [input_files]
         udpipe --train [training_opts] udpipe_model [input_files]
         udpipe --detokenize [detokenize_opts] raw_text_file [input_files]
  Running opts: --accuracy (measure accuracy only)
                --input=[conllu|generic_tokenizer|horizontal|vertical]
                --immediate (process sentences immediately during loading)
                --outfile=output file template
                --output=[conllu|matxin|horizontal|plaintext|vertical]
                --tokenize (perform tokenization)
                --tokenizer=tokenizer options, implies --tokenize
                --tag (perform tagging)
                --tagger=tagger options, implies --tag
                --parse (perform parsing)
                --parser=parser options, implies --parse
  Training opts: --method=[morphodita_parsito] which method to use
                 --heldout=heldout data file name
                 --tokenizer=tokenizer options
                 --tagger=tagger options
                 --parser=parser options
  Detokenize opts: --outfile=output file template
  Generic opts: --version
                --help


Immediate Mode
--------------

By default UDPipe loads the whole input file into memory before starting to
process it. That allows to store the space markup (see following Tokenizer
section) in most consistent way, i.e., store all spaces following a sentence in
the last token of that sentence.

However, sometimes it is desirable to process input as soon as possible, which
can be achieved by specifying the --immediate option. In immediate mode, input
is processed and printed as soon as a block of input guaranteed to contain whole
sentences is loaded. Specifically, for most input formats the input is processed
after loading an empty line (with the exception of horizontal input format and
presegmented tokenizer, where the input is processed after loading every line).


Loading Model On Demand
-----------------------

Although a model for UDPipe always has to be specified, the model is loaded only
if really needed. It is therefore possible to use for example none as the model
in case it is not required for performing the requested operation (e.g.,
converting between formats or using generic tokenizer).


Tokenizer
---------

If the --tokenize input is supplied, the input is assumed to be plain text and
is tokenized using model tokenizer. Additional arguments to the tokenizer might
be specified using --tokenizer=data option (which implies --tokenize), where
data is semicolon-separated list of the following options:
- normalized_spaces: by default, UDPipe uses custom MISC fields to exactly
  encode spaces in the original document (described below). If normalized_spaces
  option is given, only standard CoNLL-U v2 markup (SpaceAfter=No and # newpar)
  is used.
- presegmented: input file is assumed to be already segmented, with every
  sentence on a line, and is only tokenized (respecting sentence breaks)
- ranges: for every token, range in the original document is stored in format
  described below.


Preserving Original Spaces
--------------------------

By default, UDPipe uses custom MISC fields to store all spaces in the original
document. This markup is backward compatible with CoNLL-U v2 SpaceAfter=No
feature. This markup can be utilized by plaintext output format, which allows
reconstructing the original document.

Note that in theory not only spaces, but other original content can be saved in
this way (for example XML tags if the input was encoded in a XML file).

The markup uses the following MISC fields on tokens (not words in multi-word
token):
- SpacesBefore=content (by default empty): spaces/other content preceding the
  token
- SpacesAfter=content (by default a space if SpaceAfter=No feature is not
  present, empty otherwise): spaces/other content following the token
- SpacesInToken=content (by default equal to the FORM of the token): FORM of
  the token including original spaces (this is needed only if tokens are allowed
  to contain spaces and a token contains a tab or newline characters)

The content of all above three fields must be escaped to allow storing tabs and
newlines. The following C-like schema is used:
- \s: space
- \t: tab
- \r: CR character
- \n: LF character
- \p: | (pipe character)
- \\: \ (backslash character)


Preserving Token Ranges
-----------------------

When ranges tokenizer option is used, range of every token in the original
document is stored in TokenRange MISC field.

The format of the TokenRange field (inspired by Python) is TokenRange=start:end,
where start is zero-based document-level index of the start of the token
(counted in Unicode characters) and end is zero-based document-level index of
the first character following the token (i.e., the length of the token is
end-start).


Input Formats
-------------

If the tokenizer is not used, the input format can be specified using the
--input option. The individual input formats can be parametrized in the same way
a tokenizer is, by using format=data syntax. Currently supported input formats
are:
- conllu (default): the CoNLL-U format
  (http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html). Supported options:
  - v2 (default): use CoNLL-U v2
  - v1: allow loading only CoNLL-U v1 (i.e., no empty nodes and no spaces in
    forms and lemmas)
- generic_tokenizer: generic tokenizer for English-like languages (with spaces
  separating tokens and English-like punctuation). The tokenizer is rule-based
  and needs no trained model. It supports the same options as a model tokenizer,
  i.e., normalized_spaces, presegmented and ranges.
- horizontal: each sentence on a separate line, with tokens separated by
  spaces. In order to allow spaces in tokens, Unicode character 'NO-BREAK SPACE'
  (U+00A0) is considered part of token and converted to a space during loading.
- vertical: each token on a separate line, with an empty line denoting end of
  sentence; only the first tab-separated word is used as a token, the rest of
  the line is ignored

Note that a model tokenizer can be specified using --input option too, by using
tokenizer input format, for example using --input tokenizer=ranges.


Tagger
------

If the --tag input is supplied, the input is POS tagged lemmatized using the
model tagger. Additional arguments to the tagger might be specified using
--tagger=data option (which implies --tag).


Dependency Parsing
------------------

If the --parse input is supplied, the input is parsed using the model dependency
parser.  Additional arguments to the parser might be specified using
--parser=data option (which implies --parse).


Output Formats
--------------

The output format is specified using the --output option. The individual output
formats can be parametrized in the same way as input formats, by using
format=data syntax. Currently supported output formats are:
- conllu (default): the CoNLL-U format
  (http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html) Supported options:
  - v2 (default): use CoNLL-U v2
  - v1: produce output in CoNLL-U v1 format. Note that this is a lossy process,
    as empty nodes are ignored and spaces in forms and lemmas are converted to
    underscores.
- matxin: the Matxin format (http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Matxin)
- horizontal: writes the words (in the UD sense) in horizontal format, that is,
  each sentence is on a separate line, with words separated by a single space.
  Because words can contain spaces in CoNLL-U v2, the spaces in words are
  converted to Unicode character 'NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+00A0). Supported options:
  - paragraphs: if given, an empty line is printed after the end of a paragraph
    or a document (recognized by # newpar or # newdoc comments)
- plaintext: writes the tokens (in the UD sense) using original spacing. By
  default, UDPipe custom MISC features (SpacesBefore, SpacesAfter and
  SpacesInToken, see description in the Tokenizer section) are used to
  reconstruct the exact original spaces. However, if the document does not
  contain these features or if you want only normalized spacing, you can use the
  following option:
  - normalized_spaces: write one sentence on a line, and either one or no space
    between tokens, using the SpaceAfter=No feature
- vertical: each word on a separate line, with an empty line denoting end of
  sentence. Supported options:
  - paragraphs: if given, an empty line is printed after the end of a paragraph
    or a document (recognized by # newpar or # newdoc comments)


Running the UDPipe REST Server
------------------------------

UDPipe also provides REST server binary udpipe_server. The binary uses
MicroRestD (http://github.com/ufal/microrestd) as a REST server implementation
and provides UDPipe REST API
(http://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/udpipe/api-reference.php).

The full command syntax of udpipe_server is
  udpipe_server [options] port (rest_id model_file acknowledgements)*
  Options: --daemon

The udpipe_server can run either in foreground or in background (when --daemon
is used). The specified model files are loaded during start and kept in memory
all the time. This behaviour may change in future to load the models on demand.


Training UDPipe Models
----------------------

Custom UDPipe models can be trained using the following syntax:
  udpipe --train model.output [--heldout=heldout_data] training_file ...

The training data should be in CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html).

By default three model components are trained - a tokenizer, tagger and a
parser.  Any subset of the model components can be trained and a model component
may be copied from an existing model.

The training options are specified for each model component separately using the
--tokenizer, --tagger and --parser option. If a model component should not be
trained, value none should be used (e.g., --tagger=none).

The options are name=value pairs separated by a semicolon. The value can be
either a simple string value (ending by a semicolon), file content specified as
name=file:filename, or an arbitrary string value specified as
name=data:length:value, where the value is exactly length bytes long.


Reusing Components from Existing Models
---------------------------------------

The model components (tagger, parser or tagger) can be reused from existing
models, by specifying from_model=file:filename option.


Random Hyperparameter Search
----------------------------

The default values of hyperparameters is set to the values which were used the
most during UD 1.2 models training, but if you want to reach best performance,
the hyperparameters must be tuned.

Apart from manual grid search, UDPipe can perform a simple random search. You
can perform the random search by repeatedly training UDPipe (preferably in
parallel, most likely on different computers) while specifying different
training run number - some of the hyperparameters (chosen by us; you can of
course override their value by specyfing it on command line) change their value
on different training runs. The pseudorandom sequences of hyperparameters are of
course deterministic.

The training run can be specified by providing run=number option to a model
component. The run number 1 is the default one (with best hyperparameters for
the UD 1.2 models), runs 2 and more randomize the hyperparameters.


Tokenizer
---------

The tokenizer is trained using the SpaceAfter=No features in the CoNLL-U files.
If the feature is not present, a detokenizer can be used to guess the
SpaceAfter=No features according to a supplied plain text.

In order to use the detokenizer, use detokenizer=file:filename_with_plaintext
option. In UD 1.2 models, optimal performance is achieved with very small plain
texts - only 500kB.

The tokenizer recognizes the following options:
- tokenize_url (default 1): tokenize URLs and emails using a manually
  implemented recognizer
- allow_spaces (default 1 if any token contains a space, 0 otherwise): allow
  tokens to contain spaces
- epochs (default 100): the number of epochs to train the tokenizer for
- batch_size (default 50): batch size used during tokenizer training
- learning_rate (default 0.005): the learning rate used during tokenizer
  training
- dropout (default 0.1): dropout used during tokenizer training
- early_stopping (default 1 if heldout is given, 0 otherwise): perform early
  stopping, choosing training iteration maximizing sentences F1 score plus
  tokens F1 score on heldout data

During random hyperparameter search, batch_size is chosen uniformly from
{50,100} and learning_rate logarithmically from <0.0005, 0.01).


Detokenizing CoNLL-U Files
--------------------------

The --detokenizer option allows generating the SpaceAfter=No features
automatically from a given plain text. Even if the current algorithm is very
simple and makes quite a lot of mistakes, the tokenizer trained on generated
features is very close to a tokenizer trained on gold SpaceAfter=No features
(the difference in token F1 score is usually one or two tenths of percent).

The generated SpaceAfter=No features are only used during tokenizer training,
not printed. However, if you would like to obtain the CoNLL-U files with
automatic detokenization (generated SpaceAfter=No features), you can run UDPipe
with the --detokenize option. In this case, you have to supply plain text in the
given language (usually the best results are achieved with just 500kB or 1MB of
text) and UDPipe then detokenizes all given CoNLL-U files.

The complete usage with the --detokenize option is:
  udpipe --detokenize [detokenize_opts] raw_text_file [input_files]
  Detokenize opts: --outfile=output file template


Tagger
------

The tagging is currently performed using MorphoDiTa
(http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita). The UDPipe tagger consists of possibly
several MorphoDiTa models, each tagging some of the POS tags and/or lemmas.

By default, only one model is constructed, which generates all available tags
(UPOS, XPOS, Feats and Lemma). However, we found out during the UD 1.2 models
training that performance improves if one model tags the UPOS, XPOS and Feats
tags, while the other is performing lemmatization. Therefore, if you utilize two
MorphoDiTa models, by default the first one generates all tags and the second
one performs lemmatization.

The number of MorphoDiTa models can be specified using models=number parameter.
All other parameters may be either generic for all models
(guesser_suffix_rules=5), or specific for a given model
(guesser_suffix_rules_2=6), including the from_model option (therefore,
MorphoDiTa models can be trained separately and then combined together to one
UDPipe model).

Every model utilizes UPOS for disambiguation and the first model is the one
producing the UPOS tags on output.

The tagger recognizes the following options:
- use_lemma (default for the second model and also if there is only one model):
  use the lemma field internally to perform disambiguation; the lemma may be not
  outputted
- provide_lemma (default for the second model and also if there is only one
  model): produce the disambiguated lemma on output
- use_xpostag (default for the first model): use the XPOS tags internally to
  perform disambiguation; it may not be outputted
- provide_xpostag (default for the first model): produce the disambiguated XPOS
  tag on output
- use_feats (default for the first model): use the Feats internally to perform
  disambiguation; it may not be outputted
- provide_feats (default for the first model): produce the disambiguated Feats
  field on output
- dictionary_max_form_analyses (default 0 - unlimited): the number of maximum
  number of (most frequent) form analyses from UD training data that are to be
  kept in the morphological dictionary
- dictionary (default empty): use given custom morphological dictionary, where
  every line contains 5 tab-separated fields FORM, LEMMA, UPOSTAG, XPOSTAG and
  FEATS. Note that this dictionary data is appended to the dictionary created
  from UD training data, not replacing it.
- guesser_suffix_rules (default 8): number of rules generated for every suffix
- guesser_prefixes_max (default 4 if ``provide_lemma`, 0 otherwise): maximum
  number of form-generating prefixes to use in the guesser
- guesser_prefix_min_count (default 10): minimum number of occurrences of
  form-generating prefix to consider using it in the guesser
- guesser_enrich_dictionary (default 6 if no dictionary is passed, 0
  otherwise): number of rules generated for forms present in training data
  (assuming that the analyses from the training data may not be all)
- iterations (default 20): number of training iterations to perform
- early_stopping (default 1 if heldout is given, 0 otherwise): perform early
  stopping, choosing training iteration maximizing tagging accuracy on heldout
  data
- templates (default lemmatizer for second model, tagger otherwise): MorphoDiTa
  feature templates to use, either lemmatizer which focuses more on lemmas, or
  tagger which focuses more on UPOS/XPOS/FEATS

During random hyperparameter search, guesser_suffix_rules is chosen uniformly
from {5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} and guesser_enrich_dictionary is chosen uniformly from
{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.


Parser
------

The parsing is performed using Parsito (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/parsito), which
is a transition-based parser using neural network classifier.

The transition-based systems can be configured by the following options:
- transition_system (default projective): which transition system to use for
  parsing (language dependant, you can choose according to language properties
  or try all and choose the best)
  - projective: projective stack-based arc standard system with shift, left_arc
    and right_arc transitions
  - swap: fully non-projective system which extends projective system by adding
    swap transition
  - link2: partially non-projective system which extends projective system by
    adding left_arc2 and right_arc2 transitions
- transition_oracle (default dynamic/static_lazy_static whichever first is
  applicable): which transition oracle to use for the chosen transition_system:
  - transition_system=projective: available oracles are static and dynamic
    (dynamic usually gives better results, but training time is slower)
  - transition_system=swap: available oracles are static_eager and static_lazy
    (static_lazy almost always gives better results)
  - transition_system=link2: only available oracle is static
- structured_interval (default 8): use search-based oracle in addition to the
  translation_oracle specified. This almost always gives better results, but
  makes training 2-3 times slower. For details, see the paper Straka et al.
  2015: Parsing Universal Dependency Treebanks using Neural Networks and
  Search-Based Oracle
- single_root (default 1): allow only single root when parsing, and make sure
  only root node has root deprel (note that training data are checked to be in
  this format)

The Lemmas/UPOS/XPOS/FEATS used by parser are configured by:
- use_gold_tags (default 0): if false and a tagger exists, the
  Lemmas/UPOS/XPOS/FEATS for both the training and heldout data are generated by
  the tagger, otherwise they are taken from the gold data

The embeddings used by the parser can be specified as follows:
- embedding_upostag (default 20): the dimension of the UPos embedding used in
  the parser
- embedding_feats (default 20): the dimension of the Feats embedding used in
  the parser
- embedding_xpostag (default 0): the dimension of the XPos embedding used in
  the parser
- embedding_form (default 50): the dimension of the Form embedding used in the
  parser
- embedding_lemma (default 0): the dimension of the Lemma embedding used in the
  parser
- embedding_deprel (default 20): the dimension of the Deprel embedding used in
  the parser
- embedding_form_file: pre-trained word embeddings in word2vec textual format
- embedding_lemma_file: pre-trained lemma embeddings in word2vec textual format

The neural network training options:
- iterations (default 10): number of training iterations to use
- hidden_layer (default 200): the size of the hidden layer
- batch_size (default 10): batch size used during neural network training
- learning_rate (default 0.02): the learning rate used during neural network
  training
- learning_rate_final (0.001): the final learning rate used during neural
  network training
- l2 (0.5): the L2 regularization used during neural network training
- early_stopping (default 1 if heldout is given, 0 otherwise): perform early
  stopping, choosing training iteration maximizing LAS on heldout data

During random hyperparameter search, structured_interval is chosen uniformly
from {0,8,10}, learning_rate is chosen logarithmically from <0.005,0.04) and l2
is chosen uniformly from <0.2,0.6).


Pretrained Word Embeddings
--------------------------

The pretrained word embeddings for forms and lemmas can be specified in word2vec
textual format using the embedding_form_file and embedding_lemma_file options.

Note that pretraining word embeddings even on the UD data itself improves
accuracy (we use word2vec with -cbow 0 -size 50 -window 10 -negative 5 -hs 0
-sample 1e-1 -threads 12 -binary 0 -iter 15 -min-count 2 options to pretrain on
UD data after converting it to a horizontal format using udpipe
--output=horizontal).

Because forms and lemmas can contain spaces in CoNLL-U v2, these spaces are
converted to a Unicode character 'NO-BREAK SPACE' (U+00A0) before performing
embedding lookup, because spaces are usually used to delimit tokens in word
embedding generating software (both word2vec and glove use spaces to separate
words on input and on output). When using UDPipe to generate plain texts from
CoNLL-U format using --output=horizontal, this space replacing happens
automatically.

When looking up an embedding for a given word, the following possibilities are
tried in order until a match is found (or an embedding for unknown word is
returned):
- original word
- all but the first character lowercased
- all characters lowercased
- if the word contains only digits, just the first digit is tried


Measuring Model Accuracy
------------------------

Measuring custom model accuracy can be performed by running:
  udpipe --accuracy [udpipe_options] udpipe_model file ...

The command syntax is similar to the regular UDPipe operation, only the input
must be always in CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html) and the --input and --output
options are ignored.

Three different settings (depending on --tokenize(r), --tag(ger) and --parse(r))
can be evaluated:
- --tokenize(r) [--tag(ger) [--parse(r)]]: Tokenizer is used to segment and
  tokenize plain text (obtained by SpaceAfter=No features and # newdoc and #
  newpar comments in the input file). Optionally, tagger is used on the
  resulting data to obtain Lemma/UPOS/XPOS/Feats columns and eventually parser
  can be used to parse the results.

  The tokenizer is evaluated using F1-score on tokens, multi-word tokens,
  sentences and words. The words are aligned using CoNLL 2017 Shared Task in UD
  Parsing (http://universaldependencies.org/conll17) word alignment algorithm.
  The tagger and parser are evaluated on aligned words, resulting in F1 scores
  of Lemmas/UPOS/XPOS/Feats/UAS/LAS.

- --tag(ger) [--parse(r)]: The gold segmented and tokenized input is tagged
  (and then optionally parsed using the tagger outputs) and then evaluated.

- --parse(r): The gold segmented and tokenized input is parsed using gold
  morphology (Lemmas/UPOS/XPOS/Feats) and evaluated.

Model Description
-----------------

The Universal Dependencies 1.2 models contain 36 models, each consisting of a
tokenizer, tagger, lemmatizer and dependency parser, all trained using the UD
data. The model for Japanese is missing, because we do not have the license for
the required corpus of Mainichi Shinbun 1995.

The tokenizer is trained using the SpaceAfter=No features. If the features are
not present in the data, they can be filled in using raw text in the language in
question (surprisingly, quite little data suffices, we use 500kB).

The tagger, lemmatizer and parser are trained using gold UD data.

Details about model architecture and training process can be found in the
(Straka et al. 2016) paper.


Model Performance
-----------------

We present the tagger, lemmatizer and parser performance, measured on the
testing portion of the data. Only the segmentation and the tokenization of the
testing data is retained before evaluation. Therefore, the dependency parser is
evaluated without gold POS tags.

UDPipe API Reference
====================

The UDPipe API is defined in header udpipe.h and resides in ufal::udpipe
namespace. The API allows only using existing models, for custom model creation
you have to use the train_parser binary.

The strings used in the UDPipe API are always UTF-8 encoded (except from file
paths, whose encoding is system dependent).


UDPipe Versioning
-----------------

UDPipe is versioned using Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/). Therefore, a
version consists of three numbers major.minor.patch, optionally followed by a
hyphen and pre-release version info, with the following semantics:

- Stable versions have no pre-release version info, development have non-empty
  pre-release version info.
- Two versions with the same major.minor have the same API with the same
  behaviour, apart from bugs. Therefore, if only patch is increased, the new
  version is only a bug-fix release.
- If two versions v and u have the same major, but minor(v) is greater than
  minor(u), version v contains only additions to the API. In other words, the
  API of u is all present in v with the same behaviour (once again apart from
  bugs). It is therefore safe to upgrade to a newer UDPipe version with the same
  major.
- If two versions differ in major, their API may differ in any way.

Models created by UDPipe have the same behaviour in all UDPipe versions with
same major, apart from obvious bugfixes. On the other hand, models created from
the same data by different major.minor UDPipe versions may have different
behaviour.


Struct string_piece
-------------------

  struct string_piece {
    const char* str;
    size_t len;

    string_piece();
    string_piece(const char* str);
    string_piece(const char* str, size_t len);
    string_piece(const std::string& str);
  }

The string_piece is used for efficient string passing. The string referenced in
string_piece is not owned by it, so users have to make sure the referenced
string exists as long as the string_piece.


Class word
----------

  class word {
   public:
    int id;         // 0 is root, >0 is sentence word, <0 is undefined
    string form;    // form
    string lemma;   // lemma
    string upostag; // universal part-of-speech tag
    string xpostag; // language-specific part-of-speech tag
    string feats;   // list of morphological features
    int head;       // head, 0 is root, <0 is undefined
    string deprel;  // dependency relation to the head
    string deps;    // secondary dependencies
    string misc;    // miscellaneous information

    vector<int> children;

    word(int id = -1, string_piece form = string_piece());
  };

The word class represents a sentence word. The word fields correspond to CoNLL-U
fields (http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html), with the children
field representing the opposite direction of head links (the elements of the
children array are in ascending order).


Class multiword_token
---------------------

  class multiword_token {
   public:
    int id_first, id_last;
    string form;
    string misc;

    multiword_token(int id_first = -1, int id_last = -1, string_piece form = string_piece(), string_piece misc = string_piece());
  };

The multiword_token represents a multi-word token described in CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html). The multi-word token
references underlying words, it has a form and a misc field (which may contain
for example `SpaceAfter=No` feature). Other CoNLL-U word fields are guaranteed
to be empty.


Class empty_node
----------------

  class empty_node {
   public:
    int id;         // 0 is root, >0 is sentence word, <0 is undefined
    int index;      // index for the current id, should be numbered from 1, 0=undefined
    string form;    // form
    string lemma;   // lemma
    string upostag; // universal part-of-speech tag
    string xpostag; // language-specific part-of-speech tag
    string feats;   // list of morphological features
    string deps;    // secondary dependencies
    string misc;    // miscellaneous information

    empty_node(int id = -1, int index = 0) : id(id), index(index) {}
  };

The empty_node class represents an empty node from CoNLL-U 2.0, with the fields
corresponding to CoNLL-U fields
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html). For a specified id, the
index are numbered sequentially from 1.


Class sentence
--------------

  class sentence {
   public:
    sentence();

    vector<word> words;
    vector<multiword_token> multiword_tokens;
    vector<empty_node> empty_nodes;
    vector<string> comments;
    static const string root_form;

    bool empty();
    void clear();
    word& add_word(string_piece form = string_piece());
    void set_head(int id, int head, const string& deprel);
    void unlink_all_words();
  };

The sentence class represents a sentence CoNLL-U sentence
(http://universaldependencies.org/docs/format.html), which consists of:
- sequence of words stored in ascending order, with the first word (with index
  0) always being a technical root with form root_form
- sequence of multiword_tokens also stored in ascending order
- comments

Although you can manipulate the words directly, the sentence class offers
several simple node manipulation methods.


sentence::empty()
-----------------

  bool empty();

Returns true if the sentence is empty. i.e., if it contains only a technical
root node.


sentence::clear()
-----------------

  void clear();

Removes all words, multi-word tokens and comments (only the technical root word
is kept).


sentence::add_word()
--------------------

  word& add_word(string_piece form = string_piece());

Adds a new word to the sentence. The new word has first unused id, specified
form and is not linked to any other node. Reference to the new word is returned
so that other fields can be also filled.


sentence:set_head()
-------------------

  void set_head(int id, int head, const std::string& deprel);

Link the word id to the word head, with the specified dependency relation. If
the head is negative, the word id is unlinked from its current head, if any.


sentence::unlink_all_words()
----------------------------

  void unlink_all_words();

Unlink all words.


Class input_format
------------------

  class input_format {
   public:
    virtual ~input_format() {}

    virtual bool read_block(istream& is, string& block) const = 0;
    virtual void reset_document() {};
    virtual void set_text(string_piece text, bool make_copy = false) = 0;
    virtual bool next_sentence(sentence& s, string& error) = 0;

    // Static factory methods
    static input_format* new_input_format(const string& name);
    static input_format* new_conllu_input_format();
    static input_format* new_horizontal_input_format();
    static input_format* new_vertical_input_format();

    static input_format* new_presegmented_tokenizer(input_format* tokenizer);
  };

The input_format class allows loading sentences in various formats.

Th class instances may store internal state and are not thread-safe.


input_format::read_block()
--------------------------

  virtual bool read_block(istream& is, string& block) const = 0;

Read a portion of input, which is guaranteed to contain only complete sentences.
Such portion is usually a paragraph (text followed by an empty line) or a line,
but it may be more complex (i.e., in a XML-like format).


input_format::reset_document()
------------------------------

  virtual void reset_document() {};

Resets the input_format instance state. Such state is needed not only for
remembering unprocessed text of the last set_text call, but also for correct
inter-block state tracking (for example in a tokenizer which returns
document-level offsets, or in a tokenizer which tracks inter-sentence spaces -
if you pass only spaces to set_text, these spaces has to accumulate and be
returned as preceeding spaces of the next sentence).


input_format::set_text()
------------------------

  virtual void set_text(string_piece text, bool make_copy = false) = 0;

Set the text from which the sentences will be read.

If make_copy is false, only a reference to the given text is stored and the user
has to make sure it exists until the instance is destroyed or set_text is called
again. If make_copy is true, a copy of the given text is made and retained until
the instance is destroyed or set_text is called again.


input_format::next_sentence()
-----------------------------

  virtual bool next_sentence(sentence& s, string& error) = 0;

Try reading another sentence from the text specified by set_text. Returns ``true
if the sentence was read and false if the text ended or there was a read error.
The latter two conditions can be distinguished by the error parameter - if it is
empty, the text ended, if it is nonempty, it contains a description of the read
error.


input_format::new_input_format()
--------------------------------

  static input_format* new_input_format(const string& name);

Create new input_format instance, given its name. The following input formats
are currently supported:
- conllu: return the new_conllu_input_format
- horizontal: return the new_horizontal_input_format
- vertical: return the new_vertical_input_format

The new instance must be deleted after use.


input_format::new_conllu_input_format()
---------------------------------------

  static input_format* new_conllu_input_format();

Create input_format instance which loads sentences in the CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html). The new instance must
be deleted after use.


input_format::new_horizontal_input_format()
-------------------------------------------

  static input_format* new_horizontal_input_format();

Create input_format instance which loads forms from a simple horizontal format -
each sentence on a line, with word forms separated by spaces. The new instance
must be deleted after use.


input_format::new_vertical_input_format()
-----------------------------------------

  static input_format* new_vertical_input_format();

Create input_format instance which loads forms from a simple vertical format -
each word on a line, with empty line denoting end of sentence. The new instance
must be deleted after use.


input_format::new_presegmented_tokenizer()
------------------------------------------

  static input_format* new_presegmented_tokenizer(input_format* tokenizer);

Create input_format instance which acts as a tokenizer adapter - given a
tokenizer which segments anywhere, it creates a tokenizer which segments on
newline characters (by calling the tokenizer on individual lines, and if the
tokenizer segments in the middle of the line, it calls it repeatedly and merges
the results).

The new instance must be deleted after use. Note that the new instance takes
ownership of the given tokenizer and deletes it during its own deletion.


Class output_format
-------------------

  class output_format {
   public:
    virtual ~output_format() {}

    virtual void write_sentence(const sentence& s, ostream& os) = 0;
    virtual void finish_document(ostream& os) {};

    // Static factory methods
    static output_format* new_output_format(const string& name);
    static output_format* new_conllu_output_format();
    static output_format* new_matxin_output_format();
    static output_format* new_horizontal_output_format();
    static output_format* new_vertical_output_format();
  };

The output_format class allows printing sentences in various formats.

The class instances may store internal state and are not thread-safe.


output_format::write_sentence()
-------------------------------

  virtual void write_sentence(const sentence& s, ostream& os) = 0;

Write given sentence to the given output stream.

When the output format requires document-level markup, it is written
automatically when the first sentence is written using this output_format
instance (or after finish_document call).


output_format::finish_document()
--------------------------------

  virtual void finish_document(ostream& os) {};

When the output format requires document-level markup, write the end-of-document
mark and reset the output_format instance state (i.e., the next write_sentence
will write start-of-document mark).


output_format::new_output_format()
----------------------------------

  static output_format* new_output_format(const string& name);

Create new output_format instance, given its name. The following output formats
are currently supported:
- conllu: return the new_conllu_output_format
- matxin: return the new_matxin_output_format
- horizontal: return the new_horizontal_output_format
- vertical: return the new_vertical_output_format

The new instance must be deleted after use.


output_format::new_conllu_output_format()
-----------------------------------------

  static output_format* new_conllu_output_format();

Creates output_format instance for writing sentences in the CoNLL-U format
(http://universaldependencies.github.io/docs/format.html). The new instance must
be deleted after use.


output_format::new_matxin_output_format()
-----------------------------------------

  static output_format* new_matxin_output_format();

Creates output_format instance for writing sentences in the Matxin format -
UDPipe produces a XML with the following DTD:

C++ Bindings API
----------------

Bindings for other languages than C++ are created using SWIG from the C++
bindings API, which is a slightly modified version of the native C++ API. Main
changes are replacement of string_piece type by native strings and removal of
methods using istream. Here is the C++ bindings API declaration:


Helper Structures

  typedef vector<int> Children;

  typedef vector<string> Comments;

C# Bindings
-----------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the Ufal.UDPipe namespace.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. The
bindings requires native C++ library libudpipe_csharp (called udpipe_csharp on
Windows).


Java Bindings
-------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the cz.cuni.mff.ufal.udpipe package.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Java interface, see cz.cuni.mff.ufal.udpipe.Words class for
reference. Also, class members are accessible and modifiable using using
getField and setField wrappers.

The bindings require native C++ library libudpipe_java (called udpipe_java on
Windows). If the library is found in the current directory, it is used,
otherwise standard library search process is used. The path to the C++ library
can also be specified using static udpipe_java.setLibraryPath(String path) call
(before the first call inside the C++ library, of course).


Perl Bindings
-------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the Ufal::UDPipe
(http://search.cpan.org/~straka/Ufal-UDPipe/) package. The classes can be
imported into the current namespace using the :all export tag.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. Vectors do
not have native Perl interface, see Ufal::UDPipe::Words for reference. Static
methods and enumerations are available only through the module, not through
object instance.


Python Bindings
---------------

UDPipe library bindings is available in the ufal.udpipe
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ufal.udpipe) module.

The bindings is a straightforward conversion of the C++ bindings API. In Python
2, strings can be both unicode and UTF-8 encoded str, and the library always
produces unicode. In Python 3, strings must be only str.
