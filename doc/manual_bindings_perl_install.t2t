Perl UDPipe Bindings
====================

The Perl bindings are available as ``Ufal-UDPipe`` package on CPAN.

To compile Perl bindings manually, run ``make`` in the ``bindings/perl``
directory, optionally with the options described in UDPipe Installation.
Perl 5.10 and later is supported.

Path to the include headers of the required Perl version must be specified
in the ``PERL_INCLUDE`` variable using
``` make PERL_INCLUDE=path_to_Perl_includes
