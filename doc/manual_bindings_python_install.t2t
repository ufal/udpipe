Python UDPipe Bindings
======================

The Python bindings are available as ``ufal.udpipe`` package on PyPI.

To compile Python bindings manually, run ``make`` in the ``bindings/python``
directory, optionally with options described in UDPipe Installation. Both
Python 2.6+ and Python 3+ are supported.

Path to the include headers of the required Python version must be specified
in the ``PYTHON_INCLUDE`` variable using
``` make PYTHON_INCLUDE=path_to_Python_includes
