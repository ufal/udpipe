UDPipe Installation
===================

UDPipe releases are available on GitHub (http://github.com/ufal/udpipe), either
as a pre-compiled binary package, or source code only. The binary package
contains Linux, Windows and OS X binaries, Java bindings binary, C# bindings
binary, and source code of UDPipe and all language bindings. While the binary
packages do not contain compiled Python or Perl bindings, packages for those
languages are available in standard package repositories, i.e. on PyPI and CPAN.

To use UDPipe, a language model is needed. Here is a list of available language
models (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe#language_models).

If you want to compile UDPipe manually, sources are available on on GitHub
(http://github.com/ufal/udpipe), both in the pre-compiled binary package
releases (http://github.com/ufal/udpipe/releases) and in the repository itself.


Requirements
============

- g++ 4.7 or newer, clang 3.2 or newer, Visual C++ 2015 or newer
- make
- SWIG 3.0.8 or newer for language bindings other than C++


Compilation
===========

To compile UDPipe, run make in the src directory.

Make targets and options:
- exe: compile the binaries (default)
- server: compile the REST server
- lib: compile the static library
- BITS=32 or BITS=64: compile for specified 32-bit or 64-bit architecture
  instead of the default one
- MODE=release: create release build which statically links the C++ runtime and
  uses LTO
- MODE=debug: create debug build
- MODE=profile: create profile build


Platforms
---------

Platform can be selected using one of the following options:
- PLATFORM=linux, PLATFORM=linux-gcc: gcc compiler on Linux operating system,
  default on Linux
- PLATFORM=linux-clang: clang compiler on Linux, must be selected manually
- PLATFORM=osx, PLATFORM=osx-clang: clang compiler on OS X, default on OS X;
  BITS=32+64 enables multiarch build
- PLATFORM=win, PLATFORM=win-gcc: gcc compiler on Windows (TDM-GCC is well
  tested), default on Windows
- PLATFORM=win-vs: Visual C++ 2015 compiler on Windows, must be selected
  manually; note that the cl.exe compiler must be already present in PATH and
  corresponding BITS=32 or BITS=64 must be specified

Either POSIX shell or Windows CMD can be used as shell, it is detected
automatically.


Further Details
---------------

UDPipe uses C++ BuilTem system (http://github.com/ufal/cpp_builtem), please
refer to its manual if interested in all supported options.


Other language bindings
=======================


C#
--

Binary C# bindings are available in UDPipe binary packages.

To compile C# bindings manually, run make in the bindings/csharp directory,
optionally with the options described in UDPipe Installation.


Java
----

Binary Java bindings are available in UDPipe binary packages.

To compile Java bindings manually, run make in the bindings/java directory,
optionally with the options described in UDPipe Installation. Java 6 and newer
is supported.

The Java installation specified in the environment variable JAVA_HOME is used.
If the environment variable does not exist, the JAVA_HOME can be specified using
  make JAVA_HOME=path_to_Java_installation


Perl
----

The Perl bindings are available as Ufal-UDPipe package on CPAN.

To compile Perl bindings manually, run make in the bindings/perl directory,
optionally with the options described in UDPipe Installation. Perl 5.10 and
later is supported.

Path to the include headers of the required Perl version must be specified in
the PERL_INCLUDE variable using
  make PERL_INCLUDE=path_to_Perl_includes


Python
------

The Python bindings are available as ufal.udpipe package on PyPI.

To compile Python bindings manually, run make in the bindings/python directory,
optionally with options described in UDPipe Installation. Both Python 2.6+ and
Python 3+ are supported.

Path to the include headers of the required Python version must be specified in
the PYTHON_INCLUDE variable using
  make PYTHON_INCLUDE=path_to_Python_includes
