# UDPipe
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ufal/udpipe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ufal/udpipe)

UDPipe is a trainable pipeline for tokenization, tagging, lemmatization and
dependency parsing of CoNLL-U files. UDPipe is language-agnostic and can be trained given
annotated data in [CoNLL-U format](http://universaldependencies.org/format.html). Trained models are provided for
nearly all [UD treebanks](http://universaldependencies.org). UDPipe is available as a binary for Linux/Windows/OS X, as a library for
C++, Python, Perl, Java, C#, and as a web service.
Externally, [R wrapper](https://github.com/bnosac/udpipe) is also maintained.
